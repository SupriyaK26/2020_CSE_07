“Blockchain: A Panacea for Healthcare Cloud-Based Data Security and Privacy”

Healthcare is a data-intensive domain where a large amount of data is created, disseminated, stored, and accessed daily.It is clear that technology can play a significant role in enhancing the quality of care for patients (e.g. leveraging data analytics to make informed medical decisions) and potentially reduce costs by more efficiently allocating resources in terms of personnel, equipment, etc.

Generally, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)contain medical and clinical data related to a given patient and stored by the responsible healthcare provider. This facilitates the retrieval and analysis of healthcare data.
